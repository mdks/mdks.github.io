<h1>Web</h1>
<p>
  Our team takes a genuine interest in what you're trying to accomplish, helping you to realize your app's potential.
  <br>
  If you've already got an app, but it just needs some fixing, we will read the code and complete the specs.
  <br>
  If you just have an idea and don't know what to do next, we are here to help.
  <br>
  We've gained an exorbitant amount of knowledge and acquired a vast skill-set in our careers, and know how to put it to good use in helping you make progress today.
  <br>
  We've helped clients go from a business idea into a robust web application (including billing systems and CMS) deployed on a VPS or in the cloud, since 2009.
</p>

<h2>Cloud Architecture</h2>
<p>
  Our team is composed of experts in this field. We have successfully architected and shipped several systems and are more recently becoming well-versed with OpenStack and its surrounding technologies. These are exciting times indeed.

<h1>Mobile</h1>
<p>
  We have the skills and experience to create iOS and Android applications that can interface with hardware (Camera, Accelerometer, Location) and the internet (e.g. connect with your web application.).
  <br>
  We'll consult you on how best to take your system mobile (e.g. should you go native, or go with a hybrid mobile web strategy?)
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Native</h1>
<p>
  Sometimes you just need to go native. For example you may be building something that integrates with other programs on the desktop and it can only be done via a .NET, Qt, or Cocoa application.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Embedded</h1>
<p>
  We have experience with building systems using AVR microcontrollers.
  Since then, we've done much more development with Arduino.
  <br>
  Often times these embedded systems will end up talking to the cloud -- this necessitates shops like Mindynamics to be a one-stop-shop. We are no exception.
