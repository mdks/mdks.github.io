Here at Mindynamics, we value knowledge, experience, skillset, and great
personalities. We are known to share our ways with those who wish to learn.
We are often found helping out in the various technical IRC channels pertaining
to our fields (#rubyonrails, etc)<br><br>

Our members must acquire the skills to survive (by mastering) any obstacle--as
a collaborative agency, we do this together. As a result, we have have
witnessed the art of teaching/learning by doing, both in ourselves and in our
trainees.<br><br>

Those that have experienced this style of development will know that it is not
as important that you have some piece of information, but that you are able to
acquire this information quickly and use it effectively. Trial and error is
okay! Begin doing a task, seeing your mistakes, and refining the bits of
knowledge down to a sharp knife with which you can cut similar problems with in
the future.<br><br>

Anyone can learn to harness and mold the web the way we do. Feel free to make
contact.
